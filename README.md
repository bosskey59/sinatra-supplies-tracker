## Welcome to your new  Supplies Tracker!

You can use this web app to create projects and then track supplies fo each project.

A project can be anything: a class you are teaching; a vacation; a home improvement ... basically anything that uses supplies.

You can create a project with just a name. After it's created you can add optional attributes including project type and attendees (attendees are useful if the project is an event like a party or camp etc.)

From any project page, you can click update supplies to add, subtract, or create new supplies for this project. Supplies can be created with just a name and can be updated with optional attributes including vendor name and price.  

Your dashboard (link on top of every page) shows all your projects and all your supplies.

I hope you can use this free app to track the supplies in your life!

If you are really bored, you can watch this screencast of me working on the project -- I solve a few problems, run into more, and don't worry... I solved the last problem shortly after I stopped recording!
