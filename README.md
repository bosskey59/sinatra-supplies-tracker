Welcome to my Supplies tracker!

You can use this web app to create projects and then track supplies fo each project.

A project can be anything: a class you are teaching; a vacation; a home improvement ... basically anything that uses supplies.

You can create a project with just a name, but if you want to, you can also add info for other attributes including project type and attendees (if the project is an event like a party or camp etc.) On the project you can add, subtract and create new supplies.

Supplies work the same way. You can create them by name and add other optional attributes including vendor, website and price.

I hope you can use this free app to track the supplies in your life!

If you are really bored, you can watch this screencast of me working on the project -- I solve a few problems, run into more, and don't worry... I solved the last problem shortly after I stopped recording!
