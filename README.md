Welcome to my Supplies tracker!

You can use this web app to create projects and then track supplies fo each project. A project can be anything: a class you are teaching; a vacation; a home improvement ... basically anything that uses supplies.

After you create a project, you can use the Update view to create and add supplies to your project. After you click the Update button, the supplies you created will show up as supplies already assigned to your project. If you want to drop any of these supplies from the project, or add supplies from your other projects, or create more supplies, you ca do that in the update view.

Each project has a view page that includes the project's attributes, including its name, type (vacation? class? workshop project?), number of attendees and date. But you can create a project with just a name, and fill in other info, if you want to, at your leisure.

The project view page also includes a list of all supplies and their attributes including the supply's name, vendor, vendor website, units sold by and price per unit. Like projects, supplies can be created with just their names.

I hope you can use this free app to manage supplies for your projects!

My Supplies Tracker app follows MVC architecture, using ActiveRecord and SQLite 3 to manage the database; html and Ruby with ERB to manage Views, and Ruby to handle Controller logic.

Thank you for using it!

Here is a 10-minute video walkthrough of how this program works: https://www.loom.com/share/b7ba598fc12e41b6aa56a7937924dba8

If you are really bored, you can watch this screencast of me working on the project -- I solve a few problems, run into more, and don't worry... I solved the last problem shortly after I stopped recording!
