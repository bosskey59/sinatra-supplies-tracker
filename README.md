Welcome to my Supplies tracker!

You can use this web app to create projects and then track supplies fo each project.

A project can be anything: a class you are teaching; a vacation; a home improvement ... basically anything that uses supplies.

You can create a project with just a name, but if you want to, you can also add info for these attributes:

Project Type (vacation, home improvement, etc)
Date
Attendees
Supplies Budget


On the project view page, you can see your project's existing supplies, uncheck any you no longer want, add supplies from your other projects, or write in the names of new supplies to be added.

Supplies work the same way. You can create them by ame and add these other attributes if you like:

Name
Vendor
Website
Unit_type
Price_per_unit

Vendor is your vendor's name. Website is the supply's website, if it has one. Unit type is how the supply is sold, and is stored as a string, so you can enter things like "1 gallon" or "box of 12" etc.

I hope you can use this free app to track the supplies in your life!

My Supplies Tracker app follows MVC architecture, using ActiveRecord and SQLite 3 to manage the database; html and Ruby with ERB to manage Views, and Ruby to handle Controller logic.

If you are really bored, you can watch this screencast of me working on the project -- I solve a few problems, run into more, and don't worry... I solved the last problem shortly after I stopped recording!
